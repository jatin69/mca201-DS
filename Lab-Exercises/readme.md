# Lab Exercises


- [X] Lab 01: WAP to reverse a string using STL stack

- [X] Lab 02: WAP to implement templated Stack class using dynamic array

- [X] Lab 03 : Write a program to convert infix to postfix

- [X] Lab 04_A: Circular Queues using dynamic arrays
- [X] Lab 04_B: write a program to check whether a number / string is  PALINDROME with the help of STL Stack / Queue.

- [X] Lab 05_A: WAP to implement templated QUEUE class 
- [X] Lab 05_B: WAP to implement Stack using STL Queues
- [X] Lab 05_C: WAP to implement Queue using STL Stacks

- [X] Lab 06: WAP to implement templated Singly Linked List  ( class definition attached ) (small bug in def => friend class is templated, so special syntax to be taken care of)
